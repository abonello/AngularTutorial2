# Deployed Angular Website using Templates

The purpose of this project is to practice:

1. Using AngularJS to build a website using ng-view where I will load various templates

2. Publishing this same website as a GitHub page. It is only front end.

3. Deploying the same website on the web at angularTutorial.anthonybonello.co.uk

I will be using Bootstrap to format the pages.
