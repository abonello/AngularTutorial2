# Deployed Angular Website using Templates

The purpose of this project is to practice:

1. Using AngularJS to build a website using ng-view where I will load various templates

2. Publishing this same website as a GitHub page. It is only front end.

3. Deploying the same website on the web at angularTutorial.anthonybonello.co.uk. This is the code in the deplyed branch.

I will be using Bootstrap to format the pages.

NB. The htaccess and the 404.html are in the master branch and the depoyed branch as they are needed locally too.


Things to do:
* Add __Course Detail__ view and reduce the detail on the main courses view while adding a _Read More_ link. The __Course Detail__ view will have a link back to the __Individual Student__ if it was reached from there ONLY.
* Add an __Individual Student__ view which will include the name and surname as a heading, some more information about the student, example:
    * town, 
    * age, etc. 
    * It will include a photo.
    * The list of courses will show progress
    * The list of courses will link to the __Course detail__ view mentioned above.
